## Shift Bot

This project is based heavily on my previous Telegram bot, [GrahamBot](https://github.com/gmph/grahambot). Have a look in that repo for more information about its setup.

On top of the features of that bot, this one includes conversation tracking and management. This means it can have more complex conversations such as asking for a shift week, then day, then time and process data throughout.

The bot is intended to be used in user research to see how people respond to in-chat interfaces.
